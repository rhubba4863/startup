## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

RPH - Do you love naming animals at the zoo, actors on TV, or labeling those sweet cars that pass by? The Trivia app makes it so items come up and you test your memory in seeing how many you can correctly label. As each guess is made the user's guesses are tallied and displayed. Give it a go and set the new record.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - 2 HTML pages. 1 for login (and possibly topic selection), and another for guessing items name. Giving the body and structure for both pages and their popups.
- **CSS** - Appropriate styling on separate pages. Whitespace and proper color choice included.
- **Javascript** -  Controls the Trivia engine. Allowing user to login, view high scores, and and make a guess for the current picture.
- **React** - Gives Login page, Trivia page, and React to combine components of each. 
- **Service** - Backend endpoints for:
   - logging in
   - creating a user
   - retrieve picture
   - retrieve options
   - submit guess
   - retrieve correct guess count/user
- **DB/Login** - Stores users, pictures, and options in the database. Register and login the correct user.
- **WebSocket** - Once a new highscore is made, realtime that highscore onto the record list for players playing at that moment.
